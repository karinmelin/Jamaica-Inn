Hello!

Some notes on things that do not yet work in our user interface:

As user:
- When making a purchase the balance of the current user is not decreased with the total price

As admin
On pages of 'Manage user':
- 'Edit'-buttons in the table with the user info is currently not connected to anything. The thought is when this is clicked the info of the user is supposed to be read into the form to the right to make the values editable.
- Any changes with adding or editing a user will not go through to the API when clicking a 'Save...'-button

On page 'Edit stock/price'
- The same goes for these 'Edit'-buttons. Right now they don't do anything but are supposed to load the values into the form.
- The save button does not do anything either but is thought to connect and make changes to the API.

Maybe there's more things that will not functionally. We'll be happy if you write them down for us.
Happy clicking :)
